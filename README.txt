Cardiovascular and Chronic Kidney Disease Prediction

Motivation:
Improve operational efficiency of hospitals by developing a predictive model to recognize risks of cardiovascular diseases.

Makes use of:
- Pandas 
	o fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool.
- matplotlib
	o comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
- seaborn
	o based on matplotlib, high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphs.
- sklearn
	o free machine learning library, features various classification, regression, and clustering algorithms.

Includes:
- EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
- Data Cleaning
- Modeling
	o k-Nearest Neighbours 
	o Decision trees
	o Logistic regression
- Confusion matrix 
	o Evaluates the performance of a classification model on the test set
